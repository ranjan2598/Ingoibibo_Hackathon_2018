### App-A-Thon - DirtyBits

#### Problem
Midnight Booking

#### Our approach

1. Provide midnight booking to users using goibibo platform.
2. Show exclusive deals to users if hoteliers agree to it.
3. win win for both hoteliers as well as users.

#### Complete workflow

1. User share his location on whatsapp.
2. A message is broadcasted to all nearby hoteliers to confirm for exclusive deals (50% off).
3. All nearby hotels (with/without exclusive deals) are fetched to user.
4. User selects an option and booking is done.

#### How customers will be benefited

1. Users will get midnight booking.
2. Hoteliers can utilise perishable inventories.
3. For hoteliers, this will be a opaque deal. No price parity issue.
4. Hoteliers will be aware of last minute customers.

#### Challenges

Hoteliers should be online during midnight

###### Suggestion:
A staff can be made available during midnight at helpdesk or auto rules can be implemented.

#### Dependencies

Pigeon API to send and receive whatsapp notifications

#### Future Scope

1. Hoteliers can accept midnight booking on inGoibibo app.
2. Customers can book hotels on GIA or goIbibo App.
